        About Marilyn&apos;s Morsels
      </h1>
      <p className="text-base text-morselBrown/80 leading-relaxed">
        Marilyn&apos;s Morsels began in a home kitchen, where every batch was tested
        on brutally honest friends and family until the recipe was right every time.
        Today, each order is baked in a licensed home kitchen with the same care:
        real butter, premium chocolate, and a strict &quot;no shortcuts&quot; policy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-morselBrown/80 leading-relaxed">
        We keep the menu focused so every morsel that leaves the oven is consistent:
        golden edges, soft centers, and flavors that actually justify reordering.
      </p>

              I&apos;ve loved baking cookies since I was in the fifth grade, and I especially love the aroma it creates in my home. When my kids were in school, I had to keep a batch of cookies at the ready for them and their friends.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Now, many years later, those friends still keep in touch, pleading with me to share my tasty cookies with their kids.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 font-semibold text-morselCocoa">
              What an honor that is!
            </p>
            <p>
              Nine grandkids later, the aroma of fresh baked cookies still permeates my home, and my grandkids love helping me bake! I now love seeing the excitement of people&apos;s faces when I deliver them cookies. It&apos;s time for you to see why my family, my kids&apos; friends, and my current friends love my cookies!
